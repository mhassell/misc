Some makefile examples from here

Comments:

When the make command is called, it searches for makefiles with the names

	1. GNUmakefile
	2. Makefile
	3. makefile

If a makefile with one of these names is not found, then it errors.  The makefile name then needs the name of the makefile passed to it.
